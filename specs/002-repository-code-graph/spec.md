# Feature Specification: Intelligent Code Graph and Context Retrieval System

**Feature Branch**: `002-repository-code-graph`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Repository code graph with hybrid semantic and graph-based retrieval for intelligent multi-agent context selection. System indexes code structure, supports incremental updates, provides hybrid ranking using embeddings plus graph distance plus execution signals, and integrates with existing agent delegation. Must work with syntax errors and broken dependencies."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-12

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Find Relevant Code for Tasks Automatically (Priority: P1)

As a developer using multi-agent workflows, I need the system to automatically identify and retrieve all relevant code files and their dependencies when I describe a task, so that agents have the right context without me manually specifying which files to read.

**Why this priority**: Context selection is the foundation of effective agent work. Without accurate retrieval, agents work with incomplete information and produce incorrect implementations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting various natural-language tasks ("Add authentication", "Fix the payment bug", "Refactor the database layer") and verifying that retrieved files include all relevant code, tests, and interfaces without requiring manual file specification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I request "Add email validation to user registration", **When** the system searches the codebase, **Then** it returns the registration module, validation utilities, user model, related tests, and email-related interfaces
2. **Given** I request "Fix the checkout timeout issue", **When** the system analyzes execution signals (error logs, stack traces), **Then** it prioritizes files mentioned in recent errors and their immediate dependencies
3. **Given** the retrieved context includes a file that imports external libraries, **When** presenting results, **Then** the system includes interfaces or type definitions for those imports within 1-2 relationship hops
4. **Given** I'm working on a large codebase, **When** submitting a task, **Then** the system returns results in under 3 seconds with confidence scores explaining why each file was selected

---

### User Story 2 - Work with Imperfect Codebases (Priority: P1)

As a developer working on a real-world project, I need the code analysis to handle syntax errors, incomplete code, and broken dependencies gracefully, so that I can get assistance even when the codebase isn't in a perfect state.

**Why this priority**: Real codebases often have temporary issues during development. A system that only works on perfect code is impractical.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by intentionally introducing syntax errors, removing imports, and breaking references, then verifying the system still indexes most of the codebase and retrieves relevant context with confidence indicators showing which relationships are uncertain.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a file has syntax errors, **When** the system indexes the repository, **Then** it extracts as much structure as possible (file-level, partial symbols) and marks uncertain relationships with low confidence scores
2. **Given** an import statement references a missing file, **When** building the code graph, **Then** the system records the intended relationship but marks it as "unresolved" rather than failing completely
3. **Given** 20% of files have parsing issues, **When** I search for relevant code, **Then** the system still returns results from the 80% of valid files plus any partially-parsed context from problem files
4. **Given** the codebase has multiple versions of the same library, **When** resolving dependencies, **Then** the system shows which version is being used where and warns about potential conflicts

---

### User Story 3 - Maintain Up-to-Date Index Efficiently (Priority: P1)

As a developer actively coding, I need the code index to update automatically when I modify files, so that context retrieval always reflects my current codebase state without requiring manual re-indexing.

**Why this priority**: Stale indexes lead to agents working with outdated context, causing confusion and errors. Efficient incremental updates are essential for practical use.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making changes to various files, observing that only modified files are re-indexed (not the entire repository), and verifying that subsequent searches immediately reflect the changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I modify a function signature, **When** I save the file, **Then** the system updates only that file's symbols and affected relationships in under 2 seconds
2. **Given** I add a new import statement, **When** the file is updated, **Then** the system creates new relationship edges without re-processing unchanged files
3. **Given** I'm working on a 10,000-file repository, **When** I change 5 files, **Then** only those 5 files plus directly affected relationships are re-indexed
4. **Given** files are changing frequently during active development, **When** the index is updating, **Then** search queries still work using the last complete index state without blocking

---

### User Story 4 - Understand Code Relationships and Impact (Priority: P2)

As a developer planning changes, I need to visualize which code depends on my target files and which files they depend on, so that I understand the blast radius of proposed changes before making them.

**Why this priority**: After core retrieval works, understanding relationships helps developers make informed decisions and avoid breaking changes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting any file or function, requesting its relationship map, and verifying the visualization shows both upstream dependencies (what it uses) and downstream dependents (what uses it) with relationship types labeled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I select a utility function, **When** I request its relationship map, **Then** I see all modules that import it, all functions that call it, and any tests that cover it
2. **Given** I'm viewing a class, **When** exploring relationships, **Then** I see inheritance hierarchy (parents and children), overridden methods, and any interfaces it implements
3. **Given** I select a data model, **When** checking impact, **Then** I see all code that reads or writes to that model, database migration files, and API endpoints that expose it
4. **Given** relationships span multiple hops, **When** requesting impact analysis, **Then** I can expand neighbors progressively (1-hop, 2-hop, 3-hop) without overwhelming the display

---

### User Story 5 - Validate Changes with Targeted Testing (Priority: P2)

As a developer using automated workflows, I need the system to identify which tests are relevant to my changes and run those first before running the full test suite, so that I get fast feedback on whether my changes broke anything.

**Why this priority**: After retrieval and relationships are working, intelligent test selection dramatically speeds up validation loops.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by modifying a specific function, observing which tests the system selects to run (should include direct tests, integration tests touching that code path, and tests for dependent code), and verifying those tests actually exercise the changed code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I modify a utility function, **When** identifying relevant tests, **Then** the system selects unit tests for that function, integration tests that call it indirectly, and tests for any dependent modules
2. **Given** I change a database model, **When** selecting tests, **Then** the system includes tests for API endpoints using that model, service layer tests, and data migration tests
3. **Given** targeted tests pass, **When** expanding test coverage, **Then** the system runs a broader suite including tests within 2 hops of changed code before running everything
4. **Given** a test fails after my change, **When** analyzing the failure, **Then** the system shows the call path from my changed code to the failing test to help debug

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the code graph contains circular dependencies (A imports B, B imports A)?
- How does the system handle dynamically imported modules or runtime code generation that can't be statically analyzed?
- What happens when searching for code related to a term that appears in hundreds of files (e.g., "user", "data")?
- How does the system prioritize when multiple relationship paths exist between a query and candidate files?
- What happens when the repository is so large that the full graph doesn't fit in memory?
- How does retrieval work when a task description is ambiguous or uses non-standard terminology?
- What happens when execution signals (error logs) reference files that no longer exist in the current codebase? → System should display warnings for stale signals, mark with low confidence, and continue with graph/semantic components only (cap neighbor expansion at N=5 hops maximum per FR-010)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST index repository structure including files, modules, classes, functions, and tests
- **FR-002**: System MUST track relationships between code elements including: containment (file contains class), imports, function calls, inheritance/overrides, data access (reads/writes), and test coverage
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle syntax errors and broken dependencies gracefully by extracting partial structure and marking uncertain relationships with confidence scores, displaying warnings to users when relationship confidence is ≤70% (medium threshold balancing safety and usability)
- **FR-004**: System MUST support incremental indexing triggered by file save hooks (editor integration) where only modified files and affected relationships are updated within 2 seconds of save
- **FR-005**: System MUST complete full repository indexing in under 10 minutes for medium-sized codebases (5,000-10,000 files)
- **FR-006**: System MUST complete incremental updates for single file changes in under 2 seconds (95th percentile) for repositories up to 100K lines of code
- **FR-007**: System MUST retrieve relevant code for natural-language task descriptions using hybrid scoring that combines semantic similarity, graph proximity, and execution signals
- **FR-007.1**: System MUST capture execution signals from runtime data:
  - Error stack traces (file paths, line numbers from exceptions)
  - Test failure locations (pytest output, assertion file paths)
  - Runtime logs containing file/function references
  - Debugger breakpoint locations
  - Profiler hotspot file paths
  - Execution signals contribute 0.2 weight to hybrid ranking score (see FR-007)
  - When no execution signals available, use 0.0 for signal component (fallback to 0.5·embedding + 0.5·graph)
- **FR-008**: System MUST return search results in under 3 seconds with a maximum of 12 files/regions to avoid overwhelming context
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide rationales explaining why each retrieved file is relevant (e.g., "Contains UserService.authenticate() called by LoginController", "Test file for UserService", "Defines User interface imported by UserService")
- **FR-010**: System MUST support neighbor expansion where users can explore related code within N hops (1-hop, 2-hop, etc.) from any file or symbol
  - Default: N=2 hops (expand out 2 levels from matched node)
  - Configurable: 1-5 hops via query parameter
  - Edge types considered: IMPORTS, INHERITS, CALLS (FR-002)
- **FR-011**: System MUST identify test files related to code changes to enable targeted test execution before running full suites
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate impact maps showing upstream dependencies and downstream dependents for any code element
- **FR-013**: System MUST integrate with existing agent delegation system to provide context automatically when agents receive tasks, AND support manual query invocation by developers for exploration or verification (hybrid automatic + manual approach). Uses execution signals as defined in FR-007.1 for hybrid ranking.
- **FR-014**: System MUST persist index state across sessions using Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) where changes are logged immediately to disk and applied asynchronously to the main index, ensuring durability with minimal write latency, and support snapshotting for reproducible builds
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide visibility into indexing progress, errors encountered, and coverage metrics (percentage of files successfully indexed)

### Key Entities

- **Code Graph**: The complete repository structure with nodes representing code elements and edges representing relationships
- **Node**: A code element (file, module, class, function, test) with attributes (name, path, type, content hash, parse status)
- **Edge**: A relationship between nodes with attributes (type: contains/imports/calls/inherits/reads/writes/tests, confidence: high/medium/low, metadata)
- **Context Pack**: A retrieval result containing relevant files/regions, rationales for inclusion, confidence scores, and related neighbors within specified hops
- **Hybrid Score**: A weighted combination using the formula: 0.4·embedding_similarity + 0.4·(1/(1+graph_distance)) + 0.2·execution_signals. This balanced weighting equally prioritizes semantic meaning and structural relationships, with a moderate boost from runtime data. Execution signals defined in FR-007.1. When signals unavailable, fallback to 0.5·embedding + 0.5·graph (normalize remaining weights).
- **Index Snapshot**: A point-in-time capture of the code graph state used for reproducible builds and rollback
- **Impact Map**: A visualization showing all code affected by changes to a target element, organized by relationship type and hop distance
- **Execution Signal**: Runtime information (error messages, stack traces, failing tests, performance data) that informs retrieval prioritization

### Assumptions

- Repository follows standard project structure conventions (typical source, test, config directories)
- Majority of code files use common languages (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Java, etc.) with parseable syntax
- Execution signals (logs, traces) are available in machine-readable formats when present
- Users will provide task descriptions with sufficient detail (more than just one or two words)
- Index storage can grow to approximately 1-5% of total repository size
- Network latency for file access is reasonable (local filesystem or fast remote storage)
- Repository size is under 100,000 files for initial version (scalability for larger repos deferred)
- Feature delivered incrementally: Phase 1 (indexer), Phase 2 (retrieval), Phase 3 (agent integration), Phase 4 (validation), Phase 5 (visualization)
- Embeddings for semantic similarity can be computed offline or use lightweight models suitable for edge deployment
- Users working on codebases are developers with basic understanding of their project structure

### Out of Scope

- Real-time collaborative editing with live graph updates from multiple developers
- Binary file analysis (images, compiled libraries, databases)
- Natural language generation of code documentation from graph structure
- Automated refactoring suggestions based on code smell detection
- Performance profiling or runtime analysis beyond using existing execution signals
- Cross-repository analysis spanning multiple independent codebases
- Version control integration beyond detecting file changes (no automatic commit analysis)
- Machine learning model training to improve retrieval over time (use fixed hybrid scoring initially)
