- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All validation criteria met

### Specification Highlights

**5 User Stories** (Prioritized for MVP):
1. **P1 - Find Relevant Code Automatically**: Core retrieval capability for multi-agent workflows
2. **P1 - Work with Imperfect Codebases**: Error-tolerant parsing and indexing
3. **P1 - Maintain Up-to-Date Index Efficiently**: Incremental updates under 2 seconds
4. **P2 - Understand Code Relationships**: Impact analysis and dependency visualization
5. **P2 - Validate with Targeted Testing**: Intelligent test selection based on changes

**15 Functional Requirements** covering:
- Repository indexing (structure, relationships, error tolerance)
- Incremental updates (file-level, relationship-level)
- Hybrid retrieval (semantic + graph + execution signals)
- Performance targets (indexing, search, updates)
- Context packs with rationales
- Neighbor expansion and impact maps
- Agent integration
- Reproducibility (snapshots)

**10 Success Criteria** including:
- 90% retrieval accuracy for natural-language tasks
- 95% context completeness within 1-2 hops
- 10-minute full indexing for 10K file repos
- 2-second incremental updates
- 80% partial extraction from syntax-error files
- 3-second search response time
- 60% reduction in agent clarification questions

### Phased Implementation

Feature will be delivered incrementally:
- **Phase 1**: Indexer (repository scanning, error-tolerant parsing)
- **Phase 2**: Retrieval (hybrid scoring, context packs)
- **Phase 3**: Agent Integration (automatic context provision)
- **Phase 4**: Validation (targeted test selection)
- **Phase 5**: Visualization (impact maps, relationship explorer)

## Notes

- All validation criteria successfully met
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Specification is technology-agnostic and focused on user outcomes
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` (optional) or `/speckit.plan`
- Phased approach clearly documented in assumptions
- Last validation: 2025-10-12
