# Feature Specification: Autonomous Long-Running Agent Delegation System

**Feature Branch**: `001-okay-so-the`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Okay, so the main goal of the project is to be able to have really long run times with Claude Code. So we want to delegate all of the work to sub agents, have them working with the MCP, working through to-do lists or other information there. And also being able to spawn sub agents and create sub agents using the meta agent to create project specific agents where there's gaps in the current workflow. So we need to be able to design a spec that works toward those goals of exceptionally long run times with accurate deployments of code"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Delegate Complex Task to Specialized Agent (Priority: P1)

As a developer using Claude Code, I need to delegate complex, multi-step tasks to specialized agents that can work autonomously without my constant supervision, so that I can initiate long-running development workflows and receive complete, tested implementations.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all long-running workflows. Without reliable task delegation, agents cannot operate autonomously.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by initiating a multi-step task (e.g., "Create a REST API with authentication"), observing the agent delegate to appropriate sub-agents, and verifying the final deliverable is complete and functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a complex feature request spanning frontend and backend, **When** I submit the task to Claude Code, **Then** the system delegates frontend work to a frontend specialist and backend work to a backend specialist without requiring additional input from me
2. **Given** a delegated task is in progress, **When** I check the status, **Then** I can see which agents are working, what they're doing, and estimated progress
3. **Given** a sub-agent completes its work, **When** the results are returned, **Then** the orchestrating agent integrates the results and continues the workflow without manual intervention
4. **Given** a sub-agent encounters an issue it cannot resolve, **When** it needs help, **Then** it reports the specific blocker with context and waits for guidance rather than failing silently

### User Story 2 - Maintain Task Progress Across Sessions (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need the system to maintain task progress and agent state across multiple sessions, so that long-running tasks can survive interruptions, restarts, and extended execution times without losing work.

**Why this priority**: Without persistence, long-running tasks become impractical. This is critical for achieving the "exceptionally long run times" goal.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a multi-hour task, deliberately interrupting the session (close/reopen, timeout, etc.), and verifying the agents resume from the last checkpoint with all context intact.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** agents are working on a task that takes 2+ hours, **When** the session is interrupted after 30 minutes, **Then** upon resuming, agents continue from the last completed checkpoint without redoing work
2. **Given** multiple agents are working in parallel, **When** the system persists state, **Then** each agent's progress, completed tasks, and pending work are saved independently
3. **Given** an agent was using external resources (MCP servers, APIs), **When** the session resumes, **Then** the agent reconnects to those resources and continues without data loss
4. **Given** progress is being tracked, **When** I view the task status, **Then** I see a complete history of what was accomplished, what's in progress, and what remains

---

### User Story 3 - Dynamically Create Project-Specific Agents (Priority: P2)

As a developer working on a unique project, I need the system to identify gaps in the existing agent roster and automatically create specialized agents tailored to my project's specific needs, so that every task has an appropriately skilled agent available.

**Why this priority**: This enables true adaptability to any project. After core delegation (P1) works reliably, this adds the flexibility to handle unique workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by working on a project with unusual requirements (e.g., a specific framework not covered by existing agents), observing the meta-agent analyze the gap, create a new specialized agent, and successfully delegate work to it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm working on a project using a framework not covered by existing agents, **When** a task requires that framework, **Then** the meta-agent creates a new specialized agent configured for that framework
2. **Given** a new agent is created, **When** it begins working, **Then** it has access to the appropriate tools, documentation, and project context needed for its specialization
3. **Given** a project-specific agent is created, **When** I work on similar tasks later, **Then** the system reuses that agent rather than creating duplicates
4. **Given** multiple projects with different needs, **When** switching between projects, **Then** each project's custom agents are available only in the appropriate context

---

### User Story 4 - Coordinate Multi-Agent Workflows with Shared State (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need multiple agents working in parallel to coordinate their work through shared task lists and progress tracking, so that complex projects can be completed faster without agents duplicating work or creating conflicts.

**Why this priority**: After basic delegation works, parallel execution dramatically improves throughput for long-running tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by initiating a task requiring frontend, backend, and database work, observing multiple agents work simultaneously on different files, and verifying no merge conflicts or duplicate work occurs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task requires work across frontend, backend, and database, **When** agents work in parallel, **Then** each agent tracks its tasks in a shared system visible to all agents
2. **Given** two agents need to work on related code, **When** they check the shared task list, **Then** they coordinate to avoid conflicts (e.g., one waits for the other to finish a dependency)
3. **Given** agents are working in parallel, **When** one agent completes a task that unblocks others, **Then** waiting agents are notified automatically and begin their work
4. **Given** parallel work is in progress, **When** I view the status, **Then** I see all active agents, what each is working on, and how their work relates to each other

---

### User Story 5 - Ensure Code Quality Through Autonomous Testing (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need agents to autonomously write, run, and fix tests throughout the development process, so that long-running tasks produce high-quality, tested code without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Quality assurance is essential but can happen after core delegation and coordination are solid.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by delegating a feature implementation, observing agents write tests first (TDD), implement code, run tests, and automatically fix failures until all tests pass.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent is implementing a feature, **When** it begins work, **Then** it writes failing tests first before any implementation
2. **Given** tests are written, **When** the agent implements the feature, **Then** it runs tests continuously and iterates until all tests pass
3. **Given** tests fail, **When** the agent attempts fixes, **Then** it analyzes the failure, makes targeted changes, and retests (max 3 fix attempts before escalating)
4. **Given** multiple agents are working, **When** code is integrated, **Then** integration tests run automatically to catch cross-agent issues

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an agent exceeds token limits during a long-running task?
- How does the system handle agent failures or timeouts without losing progress?
- What happens when multiple agents need to modify the same file simultaneously?
- How does the system recover if MCP server connections are lost during task execution?
- What happens when a project-specific agent is created but lacks sufficient documentation or examples to be effective?
- How does the system handle circular dependencies in task delegation (Agent A waits for Agent B, which waits for Agent A)?
- What happens when an agent completes work that no longer aligns with the original task due to changes made by other agents?
