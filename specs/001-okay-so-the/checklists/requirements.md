# Specification Quality Checklist: Autonomous Long-Running Agent Delegation System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All validation criteria met

### Resolved Issues

**Issue 1: NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker (RESOLVED)**

**Original**: FR-012 - "System MUST provide checkpoint/resume capability for tasks exceeding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum expected task duration - 1 hour, 8 hours, 24+ hours?]"

**Resolution**: Updated to specify 24+ hours as the ultimate goal with phased implementation: Phase 1 (1-2 hours), Phase 2 (4-8 hours), Phase 3 (24+ hours)

**Updated Requirement**: FR-012 now reads: "System MUST provide checkpoint/resume capability for tasks exceeding 24+ hours (multi-day execution), implemented incrementally through phases: Phase 1 (1-2 hours), Phase 2 (4-8 hours), Phase 3 (24+ hours)"

**Additional Context**: Added assumption documenting the incremental delivery strategy to manage complexity and validate persistence at each scale

## Notes

- All validation criteria successfully met
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` (optional) or `/speckit.plan`
- Phased implementation approach clearly documented in both requirements and assumptions
- Last validation: 2025-10-12
